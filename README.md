Submission form notes:

_/ 1. use normalize.css with columnal: remove columnal.css resets and presets, keep the gridding
_/ 2. include modernizr.js for browser testing and support (used after base design is tested)

3. use hashslider for the questions (integrate into html)

* think of a better title for the page
